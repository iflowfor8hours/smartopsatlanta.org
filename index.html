    <h3>SmarterOps Atlanta</h3>

    <p>SmarterOps Atlanta is a network of devops practitioners.
    During the course of our work we all find ways to get smarter.  We
    deploy rapidly.  We monitor agressively.  We relentlessly strive to
    automate.  SmarterOps Atlanta is a place where system Ninjas come to share and teach the principles of agile system administration.  What once was just a series of informal discussions among friends is now an official group.  Come share your knowledge and excitement in open source system administration.</p>
