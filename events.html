    <h1>Puppet Basic Training</h1> <h3>November 12, Sandy Springs</h3>
    <p> SmarterOps Atlanta is running a Puppet training course. We're going to be doing the following:
<ul>
<li>Installing puppet</li>
<li>Using puppet interactively</li>
<li>Configuring your puppetmaster</li>
<li>Working with modules</li>
<li>Writing your first manifest</li>
<li>Applying your manifest to your nodes</li>
<li>Monitoring your nodes</li>
<li>Reading puppet reports</li>
<li>A smattering of advanced topics, to tempt you.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> Our host, ShadowSoft, will be providing the space (free parking!), some pizza, and the network, in exchange for a few minutes at the end to tell you about what they do. (hint: it's IT services.)</p>
    <p> We're targeting competent sysadmins and developers who want to elevate their expertise with puppet, or want to learn what devops is about. Beginners are more than welcome, we plan to start from the most basic concepts. The only requirement is that you have virtualbox installed and tested before you show up. </p>
